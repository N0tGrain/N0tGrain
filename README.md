# ðŸ’« About Me
I am Kaylee Hoogwerf, a big tech nerd from the Netherlands! Ever since I found out about programming, I couldn't think of something else I ever wanted to do for the rest of my life.
I am currently in my first year of my 4 year Computer Science study, where so far I have learned not only programming skills in languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Java, but also learned to work with databases and frameworks such as Springboot and Angular. I have a good eye for detail, and put a lot of effort into bringing the best possible quality product to the client! During this time I have build multiple cool projects, such as a reservation system for spaceships on our own custom spaceship, of which the frontend is seeable in the banner of this page, and my own fullstack webshop, hosted on our school's server. During these projects I have designed and developed software and applications both independently and as part of a dev-team. Here I have also worked with multiple role, such as SCRUM, front-end developer, backend-developer and data-engineer.

Besides my current study, I have a great passion for gaming and icehockey. This is why I am currently planning on creating an icehockey statistics app, which transforms real up-to-date data to a user-friendly mobile applications for users to view, and keep updated on the latest changes.
